            Welcome to Lazy P Bar Ranch and Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, incorporated in 2014
            with the goal of aiding and assisting equines who need to feel loved and properly cared for in better homes.
            It is run by Pat Potter McAndrews and her husband Butch, with the assistance of dedicated board members. The
            name "Lazy P Bar" was selected because it is the brand from our family since the 1800s.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pat was introduced to horses as a child growing up in Colorado, and has never lost her passion for these
            wonderful animals. She has ridden, raced, bred, trained, and camped with horses all her life.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Ranch is also associated with public service organizations that work in emergencies and disasters
            trying to help equines. Currently we are working on raising money to buy expensive but necessary equipment
            for trained professionals to use in animal rescue.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tax deductible donations are truly appreciated to aid in these worthy causes. Please click the "Donate"
            button above to see the ways in which you can contribute financially to Lazy P Bar Ranch and Rescue.

                    Here we have Flame. She was previously owned by an older woman who passed on. She had been abandoned at the ranch, 
                    but through time and training was found to be a wonderful trail horse.

                    Meet Shadow, a young Arabian gelding living in Humboldt County. After his previous owner could no longer care for him,
                    he was rescued and placed in a loving home with fifty acres of pasture to enjoy.
